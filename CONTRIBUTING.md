# Welcome!

We’re so glad you’re thinking about contributing to a Technology Transformation Services (TTS) open source project! If you’re unsure about anything, just ask — or submit your issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is we’ll politely ask you to change something. We appreciate all friendly contributions.

We expect everyone on the TTS team and everyone within TTS spaces, including contributors to our projects, to follow the [TTS Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

We encourage you to read this project’s CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), [README](README.md) and its [Workflow](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Workflow) process.

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [18F Open Source Policy GitHub repository]( https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy), or [send us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).
